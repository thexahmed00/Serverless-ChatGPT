# ChatGPT Serverless REST API

This project contains source code and supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the SAM CLI. It includes the following files and folders.

- hello_world - Code for the application's Lambda function.
- events - Invocation events that you can use to invoke the function.
- tests - Unit tests for the application code. 
- template.yaml - A template that defines the application's AWS resources.

The application uses several AWS resources, including Lambda functions and an API Gateway API. These resources are defined in the `template.yaml` file in this project. You can update the template to add AWS resources through the same deployment process that updates your application code.

This is a serverless REST API built with AWS SAM and AWS Lambda that uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to provide conversational AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

- An AWS account
- The AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Python 3.9 installed
- OpenAI API key

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
``` 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatgpt-serverless-rest-api.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
``` cd chatgpt-serverless-rest-api ```
3. Install the dependencies.
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
4. Configure your OpenAI API key.
``` export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here ```
5. Start the local API.
``` sam local start-api ```

## Usage
Send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/message with the following JSON body:
```
{
    "question": "Hello ChatGPT!"
} 
```

The API will respond with a JSON object containing the answer generated by the GPT-3 model:

```
{
    "version": 3,
    "message": "Hi there! How can I assist you today?"
} 
```

## Deployment
To deploy the API to AWS, run the following command:

```
sam deploy --guided
```

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
